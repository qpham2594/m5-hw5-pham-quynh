                    Hi, my name is Quynh, pronounced "Quin". I was born and raised in Vietnam, and I am currently locating in Richmond, Virginia.
                    I am fluent in both Vietnamese and English, and I love to cook. 
                    Growing up in an Asian household, cooking a meal for someone is a way to express affection so I learned to cook at a young age.
                    I recently started a garden of my own, so I am enjoying being able to use my own ingredients to cook a meal with what I already have.
                    I think trying different food is a way to learn about a culture and history. 
                    There are reasons why certain ingredients and dishes were created, whether it's due to the environment or war time. 
                    While I enjoy reading about a cutlure or learning about history of a location, I find it worthwhile to experience it through food.
                    Some of my other hobbies include dancing and photography. Dancing has been my outlet for years, and it has brought me many experiences that I would not normally be able to have.
                    As for photography, rather than being in front of the camera, my favorite part is editing the photos.
                    I do take photos, but I tend to lean toward subjects that would look good in black and white.
                    I think there is something timeless and beautiful when a photo is in black and white, and with just the right amount of contrast. 
                    However, when I am editing raw photos that have been done by others, I play around with colors more.
                    Overall, I find the process very therapeutic, and I get immersed in seeing how the entire photo could change even with just one small change.
                    I am a detailed-oriented person, so I think that's why I like the process of editing so much. <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite my love for creativity, that muscle in my brain has not been used much until recently. My entire 20's was all about healthcare, helping others, and being in high stress environments.
                    So with a career change, I am excited to hone the creative muscle and see how far I can go. 
                    With web design, I am hoping to really combined my other skills such as photography and simple artwork to create a product that someone can enjoy.
                    It's a world where you can share your knowledge, but also learn from others, and collaborate to make something with a purpose.
                    I enjoy expressing my creativity through the Internet, but with an old school kick.
                    I draw inspiration from old films, jazz and swing music, and various artworks.
                    I believe there are endless possibilities to inspire others through web design and my mission is to help others send their desired messages to the audience regardless of boundaries.
                    I am hoping to be able to create a product that can lead to positive user experience, and also to evoke inspiration as well.
